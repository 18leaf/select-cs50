# select-cs50

inheritance -> creates a lineage from given alleles. use of nodes in c

tideman -> a ranked choice voting system that compares every candidate with every other candidate, constructing a map of candidates who beat each other, while also preventing loops. used recursive functions, using adjacency matrix

These are some problems from cs50 that I were challenging and I learned the most from
